Dependencies:
    PyQT4, mencoder, mplayer

Configuration
It has almost no default values. The chosen configuration from the GUI can be
saved at any time to the mtvcgui.ini file, which will be stored in the directory
.mtvcgui in the users home directory.
A mtvcgui.ini.sample is provided, with the values I used to test it. It shows
how to add extra parameters for deinterlacing, for example. If you want to use
it, you need to rename it as mtvcgui.ini, change the norm value to the one
corresponding to your country and save it in $HOME/.mtvcgui/mtvcgui.ini

Recommended settings:
    Audio codec: mp3lame
    Video codec: lavc with mpeg4
    mencoder extra filters:
        pp=hb:a/vb:a/dr:a/al:a/lb:a

        This will do deinterlacing and some other nice stuff if it has enough
        CPU available.

        More filters can be appended separated by commas. For example if you
        also want to crop the image to remove black bars, you need to know
        the size of the original image in advance, if you want to remove 5
        pixels on the four sides of a 640x480 video, you should use this as
        extra filters:
        pp=hb:a/vb:a/dr:a/al:a/lb:a,crop=630:470:5:5

        Check "man mencoder" for video filters, and "mencoder -pphelp" for
        information about postprocessing filters.

Troubleshooting:
    Start the program from the console to get error messages and mencoder
    output. That is type ./run.py from mtvcgui directory.

    If you get a 'Cannot open demuxer.' error, you can probably solve it by
    enabling ALSA in the extra tv parameters tab. You need to specify the device
    to be used. Generally hw.0
    You can list devices with arecord --list-devices

    Black and white image can be probably misconfiguration of the norm.
    The program defaults to NTSC (normid=0). You must adjust this value to the
    norm used in your country. A tooltip with normid values will show up if you
    point over the normid scroll box.
    
    Preview doesn't work: If you get an error related with parsing the filters
    parameters, that may be because some parameters only work with mencoder and
    not with mplayer, which is used for the preview. You will have to remove
    the incompatible parameters to perform the preview.
    
    Values in norm, codec, etc dropdown lists are wrong/empty: These values
    are parsed from mplayer/mencoder output. It is very dependent of the format.
    If it changes in a future version or some string gets internationalized,
    the parsing will probably fail. Run the program from the command line and
    try to confirm if this is the case by analyzing the output and submit a bug
    in that case.
