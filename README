Dependencies:
    PyQT4

Configuration
It has almost no default values. The chosen configuration from the GUI can be
saved at any time to the mtvcgui.ini file, which will be stored in the directory
.mtvcgui in the users home directory.
A mtvcgui.ini.sample is provided, with the values I used to test it. It shows
how to add extra parameters for deinterlacing, for example. If you want to user
it, you need to rename it as mtvcgui.ini, change the norm value to the one
corresponding to your country and save it in $HOME/.mtvcgui/mtvcgui.ini

Recommended settings:
    Audio codec: mp3lame
    Video codec: lavc with mpeg4
    TV Filters:
        pp=hb/vb/dr/al/lb
        this will do deinterlacing and some other nice stuff

Troubleshooting:
    Start the program from the console to get error messages and mencoder
    output. That is type ./run.py from mtvcgui directory.

    If you get a 'Cannot open demuxer.' error, you can probably solve it by
    enabling ALSA in the extra tv parameters tab. You need to specify the device
    to be used. Generally hw.0
    You can list devices with arecord --list-devices

    Black and white image can be probably misconfiguration of the norm.
    The program defaults to NTSC (normid=0). You must adjust this value to the
    norm used in your country. A tooltip with normid values will show up if you
    point over the normid scroll box.
