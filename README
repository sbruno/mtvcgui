Dependencies:
    PyQT4

Recommended settings:
    Audio codec: mp3lame
    Video codec: lavc with mpeg4
    TV Filters:
        pp=hb/vb/dr/al/lb
        this will do deinterlacing and some other nice stuff

Troubleshooting:
    Start the program from the console to get error messages and mencoder
    output. That is type ./run.py from mtvcgui directory.

    If you get a 'Cannot open demuxer.' error, you can probably solve it by
    enabling ALSA in the extra tv parameters tab. You need to specify the device
    to be used. Generally hw.0
    You can list devices with arecord --list-devices

    Black and white image can be probably misconfiguration of the norm.
    The program defaults to NTSC (normid=0). You must adjust this value to the
    norm used in your country. A tooltip with normid values will show up if you
    point over the normid scroll box.
